## Road to "the flow"

<hr/>
I really enjoy developing software, but I have a problem, I can't focus on a single thing for a long time, 
I get distracted very easily, 
not because I don't like what I'm doing or because I'm not interested in it,
but get distracted on my phone watching videos or scrolling on twitter, 
it's a constant struggle.

I also have a lot of projects I want to do, but I am not sure how to do them or how to start with them,
but I think I should try them all and see what happens.

### My inspiration
I love to watch [FireShip](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) videos, he has the opportunity of using a lot of software 
technologies, that its something that inspires me to try and do projects in different languages and frameworks.

### My problem
I believe that the reason I am not able to create my projects is the lack of a path to follow, I often get lost thinking
in what the next step should be, or what should I do next, and I end up doing nothing.

I haven't been able to find a solution to this problem, maybe It is the lack of knowledge in the topic of the project,
I'll update this as soon as I find a solution.
