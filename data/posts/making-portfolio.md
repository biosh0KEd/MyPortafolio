## Making my portfolio

This has been a very difficult thing, but very necessary, I think as a Developer it is extremely important to have a Portfolio, because is the place where you can show what I'm capable of.

And It will be great to create a StartUp out of a project I try in here.


For me the most satisfying part of the development process is to write documentation, because it keeps your work organized, and it gives you a better perspective of what you are doing. That's why I wanted to make this for a log time, in order to get a better place where I can put all my creations and show the world what I have learned.

### I was postponing this for a long time, but it was a very big mistake.

I always thought that I needed to learn more in order to be a better software developer, but I was wrong. I have forgotten a lot of things and that make me feel very bad, as if I was just wasting my time.

But with this is different because I learn by doing something useful and by having fun.

And now I have a professional job as a programmer and I realized that it is really easier to learn when you are working in a project.
